    A Tydom hub hands out its local password only during the window that
    follows a press on its physical button. Storing the discovered value lets
    the app reconnect on its own afterwards, so the password never has to be
    written into the add-on options, a compose file or an environment
    variable.

    In a Home Assistant add-on /data is persistent, so this is transparent.
    Under plain `docker run` it is not, unless a volume is mounted: the path
    actually used is logged on every write so a non-persistent setup is
    obvious immediately rather than discovered weeks later.
